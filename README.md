- Component-based architecture
- Interactive UI elements
- Basic state management

## Technologies Used
- **React.js** - Frontend library for building user interfaces
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Core programming language
- **HTML5 & CSS3** - Markup and styling
- **Node.js** and **npm** (or **Yarn**) - Package manager for managing dependencies
